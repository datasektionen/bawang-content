# Report and Questions

Incidents and questions that you wish to submit to the Head of Equality, Diversity and Equal Treatment (JMLA) are preferably made through the form ([HERE](https://jml.datasektionen.se/)).

If you choose to remain anonymous, we will of course respect that. However, it may be that we decide we need to make a report to KTH out of necessity, depending on the incident. If you have chosen to be anonymous, that report cannot lead to any disciplinary actions, but can however lead to preventive measures such as information dissemination and seminars. If you want your report to be able to lead to more direct measures and possible disciplinary action, you cannot remain anonymous.

We can be with you every step of the way and help you with your incident report, but we will not be able to step in and mediate any cases ourselves. This is partly because we do not have the training to do so, but also because we cannot be certain to remain impartial because we know many students personally. You can read what happens when KTH receives your application [HERE](https://intra.kth.se/en/anstallning/diskriminering-och-k/ta-emot-anmalan-av-diskriminering-trakasserier-sexuella-trakasserier-och-krankande-sarbehandling-1.473199).

Certain officers of the section (D-SOL, Chapter President, JMLA and SMA) may be notified of events that are reported (assuming they are not involved themselves in the reported incident and you agree to take the matter further). This is so that we can work together to prevent similar events in the future.

## Other methods of contact
In addition to contacting JMLA via this form, there are the following methods of contact for questions or incident reports:

- You can contact JMLA directly through [jmla@datasektionen.se](mailto:jmla@datasektionen.se), through social medium of choice or by approaching JMLA in META (the Chapter Hall).
- You can talk to either of the Chapter's SSO (Student Safety Officer), JMLA (see above) or SMA. Both officeras have official (and legal) duty of confidentiality (but you can decide to take the incident further). SMA can be reached through [sma@datasektionen.se](mailto:sma@datasektionen.se).
- You can contact the Board member of Study environment and Equality (D-SOL) in the Chapter board. This person is responsible for JML-questions in the board and can be reached through [d-sol@datasektionen.se](mailto:d-sol@datasektionen.se). Worth noting is that everyone on the board can read the emails sent to any one individual board member's offical email address, and that no board member has a duty of confidentiality. 
- You can contact Head of Student Welfare at THS [studiemiljo@ths.kth.se](mailto:studiemiljo@ths.kth.se).
- You can contact the CS Master's Programme Coordinator at [cs-master@kth.se](mailto:cs-master@kth.se) or the CS International Coordinators at [exchange.out@eecs.kth.se](mailto:exchange.out@eecs.kth.se).
- You can get in touch with Head of Unit at EECS's Office of Education, Sofia Norlander, through [sofiano@kth.se](mailto:sofiano@kth.se).
- You can report incidents directly to KTH at [Report of disciplinary offence](https://intra.kth.se/en/utbildning/disciplinarenden/anmalan-av-disciplinarende-1.204198).

Which of these you choose is less important, take the path you feel most comfortable with! The most important thing is that you contact one of them so that we can do something about the situation and can help prevent similar situations in the future.
