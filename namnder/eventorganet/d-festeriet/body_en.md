# D-festeriet



D-Fest's tasks include - Organizing two parties for other officials per year, one after the Glögg-SM and one after the Val-SM. The purpose of the parties is to honor the chapter's outgoing and incoming officials. - Organize regular team building for the chapter's officials. - Possibly organize other meetings and events together with other chapters and student unions to represent the chapter externally.
