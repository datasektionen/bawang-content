# dÅre 

dÅre is the chapter's annual ski trip to Åre (which about 93.3% of the time goes to Åre). We head together up to Åre in early January for Skistar's Student Skiweek. It’s a fantastically fun trip with skiing, after-skiing, cozy hangouts, partying, and much more!

#### Who are dÅrestaben?
Well, it’s the group that makes sure this trip happens and that it becomes as amazing as possible.

### Should you go?
Yes!

See you in the slopes!
