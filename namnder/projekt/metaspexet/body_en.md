# METAspexet

METAspexet is the computer science chapter and media technology chapter's shared spex which engages over 100 students every year to put together and present a show for all who want to come and see. The project is lead by a "Direqteur" at each chapter respectively.

## What's a spex

A spex is often described as an interactive musical theater. That means, in addition to the people on stage ocationally breaking into song, that the audience can contribute to what happens by shouting things that the people on stage have to do. That makes every showing completely unique. Spex is an old student tradition that dates back all the way to the middle of the 18 hundreds.

## Is the spex for me

METAspexet consists of a number of groups with very different duties. Some do stuff on stage of course, but there are also those who write lyrics, build stage decor, program websites, throw parties, etc. If you like doing stuff in general then there's probably a corner of METAspexet that suits you! Please not that not all groups are suitable for non Swedish speakers as the shows are in Swedish.

## How do you become a part of METAspexet

Recruitment for METAspexet opens alongside the ends of the chapters receptions and is marketed basically in every imaginable communication channel. Keep your eyes peeled! Did you miss your chance? More often than not a filling recruitment opens early during the spring semester for groups that need extra support.
