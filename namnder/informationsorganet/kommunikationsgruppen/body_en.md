# Communications Group

We exist to always improve the chapter's internal and external communication. The external communication is about making sure all chapter members can easily communicate with each other, get their hand on information about how the chapter works and looks like as well as, without friction, finding out what's happening in the form of events and other stuff happening. The external communication is instead about making sure curious future students get to know what computer science students at KTH does and making sure companies knows who we are.

To accomplish this we in the Communications Group work towards making the chapter's communication channels are effective and making the chapter's official social media, like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/datasektionen/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KongligDatasektionen), active and educational!

## How do you join the Communications Group?
