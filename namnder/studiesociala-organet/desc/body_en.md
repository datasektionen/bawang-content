# DESC

DESC (*Datas E-Sports Community*) is the CS chapter's gaming club. Our mission is to spread the joy of gaming to the CS chapter. We have an internal group that organizes LANs and game nights for the chapter.

## What we do

We organize a slew of activities related to e-sports and gaming in general. For example, we...

* attend Dreamhack Winter yearly (sponsored by the chapter),
* organize LANs that go on for entire weekends,
* organize tournaments with prizes in META,
* manage the chapters Nintendo Switch and VR gear,
* watch e-sports events in META,
* hold on- and offline gaming nights,
* speedrun Dark Souls,
* get wrecked in Overwatch,
* encourage members of the chapter to play more video games with eachother.

Any other time we're hanging out in the Discord server.
