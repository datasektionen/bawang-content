# METAdorerna

"The task of METAdorerna is to be responsible for the operation of the META chapter hall, Osquars backe 21"

We in METAdorerna work to ensure that chapter members have a pleasant place to go to for study and fellowship. We coordinate cleaning, new construction and maintenance.

META is also a party venue, so in cooperation with our barteams we make sure the beer coolers and the bass amp are working. It is also possible for chapter committees to book META for parties/activities.

## Error reporting and improvement proposals

Do you have any comments about the premises, anything that could be improved or should be handled differently? For bug reports and improvements to META, please use the link in the sidebar.

## Städskrii - Monday cleaning

We are the ones who hold the Monday cleanings in Meta during the year. We invite newcomers to help clean up and learn where everything is in the chapter hall and how the garbage disposal works. Everyone who helps clean 2 times gets to attend a lavish party at the end of the year. Cleaning takes place on Mondays starting at 5:17pm in the first-year-student groups and takes about an hour after school. If it is not convenient to clean at the allotted time, you can come by on another Monday or at one of the designated extra sessions towards the end of the term.
