# The Study Board

## About the Board

Like every Chapter at KTH, the CS-Chapter has a Study Board which works with monitoring the education at EECS. The main purpose of the Board is to assess and improve education quality as well as studying environment in both the short and long term.

For you, this means that we will give your feedback to teachers and other officials at EECS in order to improve the CS education. If you have any thoughts regarding your education you can contact us via mail. There is also an opportunity to participate in our open meetings, where we discuss current issues and problems in the courses. For more information about our meetings and their schedule, email the Chairman of the Study Board (SNO), Soma, at [sno@datasektionen.se](mailto:sno@datasektionen.se).

We also answer your questions regarding your studies at kth or redirect you to a more knowledgeable party.
Contact us if you have questions or opinions regarding the education or the studying environment by emailing the relevant person. Their emailadresses can be found below! If you don't know who to contact email the Chairperson of the Study Council (SNO) at [sno@datasektionen.se](mailto:sno@datasektionen.se)

### Board Meetings

The study board meetings are held at least once per period. The meetings are open to all chapter members, and one can always bring up education related questions or the Board operations. Otherwise, we discuss current problems in the education, and the board officials give reports on what they have been doing since the last meeting.

Earlier meeting protocols can be found [here](https://dsekt.se/snprotokoll)

## Contacts

### Year representatives & Master representatives

Are your lectures incomprehensible? Are there too few opportunities to present your work? Or do you want someone to act as a middle-man between you and the school? Rest assured, we have got your back!

The Year and Master representatives are students who represent their year in relation to both students and teachers. Functionally, they are a voice for students in situations where the students don't want to or cannot communicate with the teacers. Should you have opinions about the courses, teachers or related subjects, your Year representative has got you covered.
