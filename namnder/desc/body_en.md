# DESC

DESC (*Datas E-Sports Community*) is the CS chapter's gaming club. Our mission is to spread the joy of gaming to the CS chapter. We are an open club: if you're a member in the chapter, you're a member of DESC. DESC is headed by the Desctop, elected at Val-SM each year.

## What we do

We organize a slew of activities related to e-sports and gaming in general. For example, we...

* attend Dreamhack Winter yearly (sponsored by the chapter),
* organize tournaments with prizes in META,
* watch e-sports events in META,
* hold on- and offline gaming nights,
* speed run Dark Souls,
* convince fellow students to show off their VR gear,
* get wrecked in Overwatch,
* encourage members of the chapter to play more video games with eachother.

Any other time we're hanging out in the Discord server.
