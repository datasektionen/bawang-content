# _Konglig Datasektionen_

<sub>TODO: translate more at the end</sub>

Datasektionen, or the Computer Science Chapter is a non-profit 
[student chapter](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentsektion)
under [THS](http://ths.kth.se) which exists to give all CS students at
KTH the best study time possible. We achieve this in part by monitoring
the courses in the programme, and in part by organizing activities 
outside of the studies themselves. We're a bit like a watchdog, and
a bit like a fraternity (but more open). In the chapter there are 
several groups doing specific stuff that interests them. Read more about 
those below!

Party activities, DKM
-------------------

Few engineering students could go longer than a few days without partying.
To satisty this need, we have DKM, or the Club Masters of Data. 
[DKM](/namnder/dkm), is made up of a few nice people who organize totally
incredible parties. You must think they are awesome. They are. 
Parties are helt at META almost every wednesay.


Activities and entertainment
-----------------------------

There are many ways to have fun at the CS chater. Apart from interesting 
studies and epic parties, _qultiral_ events are sometimes organized. This 
could be film- or gaming evenings. We also collaborate with other groups to 
spread _qulture_ all around the campus. Looking for company? We can help!

Keeping an eye on the studies...
---------------

The study council makes sure that all CS students get the best education
possible. We meet at least once a period and discuss how things are going 
in all the different courses and programmes. If you're experiencing problems 
with the faculty or a course, you should contact us!  The study council is 
open for all CS students, so anyone can come to our meetings.

Industry contact
------------------

The industry group takes care of the chapter's contact with the professional
world. We organize events together with interested companies, such as the yearly
D-dagen CS job fair, company pubs, lunch lectures, and other events. We
also help companies advertize jobs and sometimes organize something special.

META, our Chapter Hall
-------------

META is the hall where CS and Media students can meet, eat and party. 
The address is Osquars Backe 21 and the heroes taking care of the place
are _METAdorerna_.

Information distribution (or, the hacker club)
---------------------

IOR (eeyore) started as a group to facilitate spreading of information
in the chapter (e.g. through this website, which we develop!), but has 
morphed in the the CS Chapter's _hacker club_. We make sure the website,
and all other projects are up and running, and there are many of those. 
Want more programming in your life? Or maybe you're a good designer, 
tester, developer, or just like ice cream? Join us at a hackathon every\* 
thursday in comptuter room Grå (fifth floor, E building). 

\*We're not really that punctual and sometimes miss thursdays. Check our

Student Reception
---------------------------

The reception is very important for welcoming new students and making sure they 
feel good coming here. The schedule and other information can be found at
the [reception website](/namnder/mottagningen).

Board
--------

The board, or ”D-rektoratet” has the overarching responsibility for everything
that happens in the CS chapter. They are the bosses, you could say. Each member
has their share of responsibilities, and they are elected during _SM_, Chapter
Meetings. Their main task is realizing democratic decisions made by the Chapter.

Chapter Paper
---------------

[dbuggen](http://dbu.gg) is the CS chapter's own paper!

Equality work
----------------

The equality council works to make everyone feel safe, accepted and treated
equally at the CS section. You can turn here if you have questions about 
discrimination, unfair treatment, or similar issues. No issue is too small!
If you like combatting inequalities you should definitely [join](/namnder/jamlikhetsnamnden).

The Spex
----

A _Spex_ is a theatrical student event of sorts.
METAspexet is a collabortion between the CS and Media chapters. It brings
joy to the members of the chapters. THe [spex](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spex), is full of 
music, dance, comedy, and more. It's hard to describe. But you should see it!

Sports
-----------------

The Sport group does whatever its members feel like doing. Football, hockey,
running, it varies a lot. Join here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/datafotboll/
