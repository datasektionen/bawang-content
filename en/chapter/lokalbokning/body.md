## To book META

To book META please use the booking system at
**[bokning.datasektionen.se](http://bokning.datasektionen.se)**. If you
have any questions, please contact the chapter-house bosses by email,
**[lokalbokning@datasektionen.se](mailto:lokalbokning@datasektionen.se)**. The email
goes to both the representative from the Computer Science and Media chapter
(but CS will most likely reply to you). You need to be a
member of the chapter in order to book META. If you want to know all the rules,
please ask in your email.

In the booking page you can choose to book META (the entire chapter hall) or the meeting room.
When booking META, please specify whether or not you are going to serve alcohol (not necessary if you only
book the meetingroom).

In this year's [cohabitation agreement](https://static.datasektionen.se/organisation/samboendeavtal2020) (2020)  it is stated (note that the text is translated):

<br>
*More than three (3) repeated bookings for a time in the week may not
occur, this to avoid overbooking of the meeting room. Exceptions apply
to chapter boards, which may have a recurrent time of the week.
Exceptions may also be granted by the local managers or issued in
conjunction with booking META*

This is interpreted as that you may not book a fourth time before the
first three bookings are used. Note that this only applies to bookings
at the same time (for example, Wednesday 10-12).
