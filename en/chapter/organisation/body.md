# Organisation

The Computer Science Chapter is a nonprofit organisation that works for its
members interest. We have by-laws and a board of directors – and a lot of documents. At first hand we follow the Swedish laws as a nonprofit organisation. We also follow to the KTH Student Union bylaws,
rules and white paper.

The Computer Science Chapter also have their own regulatory documents. To regulate our own activities we got our [by-laws](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/stadgar) and our volunteers
[rules](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/reglemente).
[Our treasurer](https://dfunkt.datasektionen.se/position/id/9) is responsible for the chapter's economic routines - you will find them in the [Economic Policy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/ekonomiskt_styrdokument).

The Computer Science Chapter are also proud proprietors of a permanent
license to serve alcohol and thus we follow the Swedish Alcohol Law(Alkohollag:2010:1622). To be clear to all our members about our view on alcohol in our chapter hall and our activities
[Alcohol Policy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/alkoholpolicy).

Other policies we commit to are
[Recruitment Policy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/rekryteringspolicy),
[d-Funk Policy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/dfunkpolicy) and our
[Information Distribution Guidelines](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/informationsspridningsguidelines).
You can also find them listed on the right side of this page. We also have a [Cohabitatation Agreement](https://dsekt.se/samboendeavtal) regulating how the chapter hall META is shared between The Computer Science Chapter and the Chapter for Media Technology. 

### Members

Members are everyone who pays the chapter fee. The board of directors are members,
the volunteers are members, and we hope that you are a member! Every
member is allowed to attend and vote at the chapter meetings(SM).

### Clubs
<img src="https://dsekt-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/organisation/verksamhetskarta-2023-10-19.png" style="width:100%;" />

A club is an organisational entity created for a specific purpose. One of our clubs monitors our study environment, another takes care of the sektionslokal, another arrange parties and so forth. Every club has a chairman that is elected at the SM. How to become member of a club varies from which club it is. Some clubs has a limit to how many members they bring in and some have
interviews. If you want to know more a bout a certain club, you are welcome to contact the club's chairman! ([Here](dfunkt.datasektionen.se) are their contact information).
If you want to create your own club by sending a motion to the board of directors. At the next Chapter Meeting, all members votes if your proposal should pass. You should make a budget, a description of your activities, and possibly formulate changes in our by-laws/rules.

It's also possible to make a project in the chapter. A project is similar to a temporary club, it is created the same way, with a motion.

### Volunteers

Volunteers are also elected at a chapter meeting. Every volunteer is responsible for one club or activity in the chapter. If you want to get engaged in a club or activity you are welcome to turn to its volunteer!

If you want to be a volunteer you have to candidate in an election. Out elections are made at the Election Chapter Meeting (mid Mau) and Mulled Wine Chapter Meeting (Late November/early December) and the nomination period starts rougly one month before the meetings. To nominate and handle your nominations go to our [election page](val.datasektionen.se). If you are intrested in knowing what the responsible of a position is, you can contact
the current volunteer.

### D-directorate

The D-directorate is the board of the Computer Science chapter and consists of seven members.
They are the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer, secretary, and three more board members that are responsible
for educational issues, student welfare, and business relations. Together they arrange Chapter Meetings, make sure
the decisions at chapter meetings are executed, coordinate different parts of the chapter, and make strategic and long term plans.

Elections for board members are made in the same way as for volunteers, except for Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Tresurer.

### Statutory Auditor

The Statutory Auditor is the one that performs audit through verifying the bookkeeping, quorum and activity in an organisation. The Computer Science Chapter's Auditor examines bookkeeping and meeting protocols every year to decide if the board has done their job properly.

### How are things decided?

If you want to suggest an alteration in the documents you leave a
motion to SM. To change the by-laws it is required two consecutive
SM-decisions.

### Chapter Meeting(Sektionsmöte, SM)

Chapter meeting, or SM, is the chapter's highest decision-making body. They could be compared with the Computer Science Chapter's annual meeting, but there are multiple every year. Every member of the Computer Science Chapter have a right to speak their mind and vote at the SM. The most important decisions affecting the chapter are made on the SM. There are four
stated SM in the year; Budget-SM (Budget Meeting), and Glögg-SM (Christmas Meeting), Revisions-SM (Audit meeting), and
Val-SM (Election Meeting). More chapter meetings could be arranged.

### D-directorate Meeting (D-rektoratsmöten, DM)

The Board of Directors Meeting. All of the chapter members have the right to attend and speak, but only the board have the right to vote. Every volunteer gets an invitation to DM but it's only the members of the D-directoate that are expected to attend. If a voluenteer has sent a proposal to
the board that will be handled in the meeting, they are also expected to attend.
