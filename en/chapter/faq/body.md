# FAQ

### How do I become a member?
You become a member by studying one of the programs that belong to the chapter and paying your [membership fee to THS](https://thskth.se/membership).

### What can I do if I'm not a member?
You can always study in our chapter hall META (Osquars Backe 21) between 6-17, but to take part in the events that the chapter arranges or to join its clubs you need to be a member.

### How do i learn about the events that the chapter arranges?
Every event that the chapter arranges is posted on our website! They're displayed in our normal news-feed but if you only want to see events that are posted or see the event-calendar you can go to [Event](https://datasektionen.se/en/news?itemType=EVENT).

### How do i impact the chapter?
There are multiple ways to impact the chapter. First and foremost you can talk to another member, a chapter official, or a member of the chapter's board to see if your proposed change can be done through unofficial means.

If this isn't the case you can instead submit a motion to the next chapter meeting (SM). You can read a Swedish guide on how to write a motion [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ydBX1wnQHgXiFULoto7GK2T819r0Sbc8-zyE32zGGw/edit?usp=drive_link) or message the chapter's [secretary](mailto:sekreterare@datasektionen.se) if you have any questions.

### How do I join a club?
Every club recruits members in a different way. Some are open and you can join them whenever you want to while others are closed and recruit new members 1-2 times a year. If you want to learn how to join a club or when their recruitment opens you can message the clubs chairman.

You find all of the chapters clubs and their officials under [Clubs](/en/clubs).

### How do I organize an event?
You learn how to organize an event or party in the Swedish document [How2Event](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xmbr46HlLkXXaY_vYVd0KQBfDczmtabL3EhGByZDkxw/edit?usp=sharing).
