## FAQ concerning parties, arrangements and events

### I would love to organize a party, but I don't know how to...

Technically, anyone can organize a party or event. However, to organize an
event you have to be a member of the Computer Science chapter. You also need
to figure out a location, get a permit, and have a
person that is qualified to be responsible for the event.
For more information, email the chapter's board at [drek@datasektionen.se](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

#### Do I need to be a chapter member to do stuff?

Yep. The only thing you can do without being a member, is spending time in META (our chaper Hall) between 06:00 and 17:00.

#### I need a location, can I use META?

The chapter regulations state the following (unofficial translation):
§7: META may only be booked by the Computer Science chapter functionaries, as well as
organs within the THS, and other organizations. But contact the club or
organisation that fits with the activity you want to organize, and hopefully
they can help you. Bookings are done [here](https://bokning.datasektionen.se/bookings/7).

If you are unsure, contact the board.

#### Are there other locations than META that I can book?

Sure. THS has halls specifically for parties. While nice, these tend to
cost more than the Computer Science chapter's halls.

#### What is a party application?

A party application is good to have in order to notify guards about your event.
If you intend to host any event with more than 50 participants, you must make an application or
if you want to serve alcohol. Need any help? Contact [the head of the chapter](ordf@datasektionen.se)
or the [head of the bar](mailto:klubbm@datasektionen.se).


#### What if I want to serve alcohol?

If want to serve alcohol there has to be someone who has taken
[STAD course](http://www.stad.org/en/about-stad) and passed the exam. In addition to this the person
has to be registered in the database of people allowed to be in charge of serving in META. Talk to
the [chairman](mailto:ordf@datasektionen.se) if you are unsure about any of this.

If the event isn't in META other rules may apply.

#### How can I get information about party locations?

Talk to the head of the hall/location, e.g. [the head of the chapter hall](mailto:lokalchef@datasektionen.se) if you're booking META.

### How to get economic support for chapter activity

Do you have an event idea or do you need to make an important purchase? You can always apply for economic support from the chapter in case you lack resources.

### What kind of money?

The head of the chapter, D-directorate (the board) and the chapter meeting (SM) can all make decisions on funding activities and purchases related to the chapter. The head can approve total sums of 2000 kr and the board, 30 000 kr. The chapter meeting does not have a limit. Economic resources are handed out from the disposition fund.

### What do I need to do?

Just need a small push? If you need less than 2000 kr, you can simply mail the chapter head with a justification. Usually those requests are not
approved unless it is very rugent.

For sums between 2000 and 30 000 kr, you must wait for the board to come to a decision during a board meeting. Send a mail to [the board](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se) with a justification. You are welcome to join the meeting, announced five days before, to present your application and to answer questions.

Applications with sums above 30 000 kr need to pass on the chapter meeting. Send a motion to the board meeting preceding the chapter meeting with your justification. You can also ask for help on formalia or discuss your idea. You are requested to join the meeting in order to discuss about your motion. Following the board meeting, an answer from the board regarding your motion will be announced during the chapter meeting. A LaTeX template for motions can be found, under "Motion", [here](https://motioner.datasektionen.se/).
