# Graphical profile

The chapter is developing a graphical profile in order to standardise **typography, colours and use of the chapter logo**. The profile has been used during the development of the chapter's new webpage and will make everyone happy, should it be used in other contexts too.

* The chapter uses the Lato font
* The primary colour is **cerise**, with shades _strong_ (#EE2A7B), _regular_ (#E83D84) and _light_ (#EC5F99)
* Accent colours are off-black (#212121), yellow (#FCDA04) and off-white (#F7F7F7)
* The black delta logo shall be used on light backgrounds and the white delta logo, on dark backgrounds

There are [guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasektionen/UI/master/Ref_Sheet/ref_sheet.png) for graphical interfaces. Graphical resources are hosted on the chapter's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/datasektionen/UI/).

Please observe, the graphical profile is under development and updates will be posted here.
