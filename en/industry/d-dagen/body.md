# D-Dagen

D-Dagen is the Computer Science Chapter's annual work fair. Hosted by
students, D-Dagen creates a space for computer science students and
companies to interact and develop relations. This year, the work fair takes place
on the 10th October at the KTH campus on Valhallav√§gen. A traditional
three-course student dinner follows the fair, followed by a pub in order
for you to mingle with students in a more relaxed environment. You will
have the possibility to offer drinks to students using drink coupons.
Company representatives will receive breakfast, lunch,
dinner and fika during the day.
