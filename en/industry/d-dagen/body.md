# D-Dagen

D-Dagen is the Computer Science Chapter's annual work fair. Hosted by 
students, D-Dagen creates a space for computer science students and 
companies to interact and develop relations. The work fair takes place
at the KTH Campus on Valhallav√§gen. A traditional three-course student 
dinner follows the fair, followed by a pub in order for you to mingle
with students in a more relaxed environment. You will have the possibility
to offer drinks to students using drink coupons. You and other company
representatives will receive breakfast, lunch, dinner and fika.
