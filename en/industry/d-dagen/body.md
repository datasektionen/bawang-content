# D-Dagen

D-Dagen is the Computer Science Chapter's annual work fair. Hosted by 
students, D-Dagen creates a space for computer science students and 
companies to interact and develop relations. This year, the work fair takes place
on the 11th October at the KTH campus on Valhallav√§gen. A traditional 
three-course student dinner follows the fair, followed by a pub in order 
for you to mingle with students in a more relaxed environment. You will 
have the possibility to offer drinks to students using drink coupons. 
Company representatives will receive breakfast, lunch, 
dinner and fika during the day.
