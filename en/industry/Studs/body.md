# Studs
## The Project
We provide a platform made for interactions between soon-to-be graduates and their future employers. By arranging personal gatherings we establish a valuable contact between you as a company and the 31 master students participating in the Studs project. Work with studs to find the perfect match of our students and your company! 

## Work with Us
Throughout the year the project members will meet companies for events, typically taking place in the companies’ offices. This is an opportunity for the students to gain insights into the company and its business. Studs’ skilled event group helps the companies to customize the events according to their wishes, which ensures events as unique as the companies behind them. After the event the company is marketed on our website and in our social media channels LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram.
