# Business Relations

Do you want to come in contact with computer science students?
The Computer Science Chapter's Business Relations Group actively works for an increased
cooperation beetween computer science students and the industry. We will help
you arrange events in order for students to come in contact with your company
and to give them a glimpse of their future working life.

We offer many ways for you to contact students: lunch lectures, advertisment,
using the Computer Science Chapter's job board, etc. We will also gladly discuss
any new ideas with you. Looking for a more traditional approach? Take a look at
our traditional events, listed below.

Please feel free to contact us within the Business Relations Group by mail or phone
for more information.

## Pub

Take the chance to present your company at one of our popular Wednesday pubs,
where many computer science students stay to eat and drink after their lectures.
It is be a good opportunity to mingle with students in a more relaxed enviroment
as well as to present your company. A lecture can be held beforehand as well, if
desired. We stand for staff and will help you with advertisement.

## Lunch lecture

Lunch lectures are often very appreciated by students. You will hold a
presentation during lunch (12:15-13:00) in front of around 100 students.
Students will receive a simple lunch before the presentation, sponsored
by you. The contents of the lecture is completely up to you and, if
desired, the food too. You can, for instance, present your company, projects or
trainee programmes.

## Advertisement on social media
