# International Committee

The International Committee of the Computer Science Chapter is responsible for all international activities of the Computer Science Chapter and is shared with the Media Technology Chapter. The committee is led by the Data Chapter's International Student Coordinator (fall 2023-: HÃ¥vard Alstadheim) and the Chapter for Media Technology's International Coordinator (2024: Elena Pan and Erik Sevelin).


## General

The International Committee focuses on introducing international students to our Chapter. This includes organizing events for international students, helping international students to participate in Computer Science Chapter activities, and providing a platform for cultural exchange between Swedish and international students. The committee is open to all students in the Computer Science Chapter, regardless of whether they are international or not.

# Join the committee

By getting involved in the committee, organizers can earn hours towards the 0.2 bonus points used to apply for study abroad. It takes 25 hours of involvement within the span of four months to earn the bonus points, and the Head of the Committee (International Student Coordinator) is responsible for counting and reporting the hours to THS.

The committee recruits new members all year round. Members can be event organizers, or do several other tasks such as coordinating communication or translation work. If you are interested in joining the committee, please write to [isc@datasektionen.se](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se).

## Reducing Barriers for International Students

The International Committee has a project called "Translating Governance Documents". The project aims to translate [important documents](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/) into English so that international students can get a better understanding of what is happening in the Computer Science Chapter. This project is open to all students in the Computer Science Chapter. If you are interested in helping with this, contact [isc@datasektionen.se](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se).

## Events

The International Committee organizes at least two events per semester for international students that are members of the Computer Science Chapter or the Media Technology Chapter.
Examples of events include international gasques, movie nights, board game nights, karaoke nights, networking events (to introduce the Chapter's committees/clubs), and outdoor activities such as ice skating or hiking. Moreover, at the beginning of each semester, the committee collaborates with the Computer Science reception (only in the autumn semester) and the international reception organized by THS (every semester). 

## International Reception

THS organizes a reception for international students at the beginning of each semester. The International Committee organizes Chapter specific events in collaboration with the THS International Reception. The reception is a great opportunity to meet international students and participate in fun activities. If you want to help only with chapter specific events, you can do that through the International Committee. If you instead want to be a part of the THS International Reception as a whole, you can for example become a buddy.
