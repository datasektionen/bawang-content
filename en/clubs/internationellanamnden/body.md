# International Committee

The International Committee of the Computer Science Chapter is responsible for all international activities of the Computer Science Chapter and is shared with the Media Technology Chapter. The committee is led by the Data Chapter's International Student Coordinator (spring semester 2023: Valentin Quapil) and the Chapter for Media Technology's International Coordinator (2023: Lovisa Cond√©).


## General

The International Committee focuses on introducing international students to our Chapter. This includes organizing events for international students, helping international students to participate in Computer Science Chapter activities, and providing a platform for cultural exchange between Swedish and international students. The committee is open to all students in the Computer Science Chapter, regardless of whether they are international or not.

# Join the committee

By getting involved in the committee, organizers can earn hours towards the 0.2 bonus points used to apply for study abroad. It takes 25 hours of involvement over four months to earn the bonus points, and the Head of the Committee (International Student Coordinator) is responsible for counting and reporting the hours to THS.

The committee recruits at the beginning of each semester when several organizers who are interested in the organization of events are recruited. However, the committee is open to new organizers all year round. If you are interested in joining the committee, please apply for membership (write to [isc@datasektionen.se](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se)).

## Reducing Barriers for International Students

The International Committee has a project called "Translating Governance Documents". The project aims to translate [important documents](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/) into English so that international students can get a better understanding of what is happening in the Computer Science Chapter. This project is open to all students in the Computer Science Chapter. If you are interested in helping with this, contact [isc@datasektionen.se](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se).

## Events

The International Committee organizes at least two events per semester for international students that are members of the Computer Science Chapter or the Media Technology Chapter.
Examples of events include international gasques, movie nights, board game nights, karaoke nights, networking events (to introduce the Chapter's committees/clubs), and outdoor activities such as ice skating or hiking. Moreover, at the beginning of each semester, the committee collaborates with the the international reception organized by THS. 

## International Reception

The International Committee is not responsible for the international reception. THS organizes a reception for international students at the beginning of each semester. The reception is a great opportunity to meet international students and participate in fun activities.
