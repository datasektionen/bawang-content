# The International Club

The International Club is the Computer Science Chapter's International Group!

This is a shared group between the Computer Science Chapter and the Chapter for Media Technology. The group organizes at least two events per semester for computer science students and media technology students. The group recruits new excited organizers at the beginning of each semester, but is open to new organizers all year round.

By helping out in the group organizers can collect hours to count toward their 0.2 GPA bonus to the GPA points that are used to apply for international studies. The group leaders are responsible for registering the hours with THS. If you are interested in joining the group as an organizer, then apply for membership in the organizers' group: [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2151534464869750/)
