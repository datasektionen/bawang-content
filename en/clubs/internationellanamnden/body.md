# International Committee (Internationella nämnden)

The International Committee of the Computer Science Chapter is responsible for all international activities of the Computer Science Chapeter and is shared with the Media Technology Chapter. Led by the Data Chapter's International Student Coordinator (Valentin Quapil) and the Chapter for Media Technology's International Coordinator (Lovisa Condé).


## General

The International Committee focuses on introducing international students to our Chapter. This includes organising events for international students, helping international students to participate in Computer Science Chapter activities and providing a platform for cultural exchange between Swedish and international students. The committee is open to all students in the Computer Science Chapter, regardless of whether you are international or not.

# Join the committee

By getting involved in the committee, organizers can earn hours towards the 0.2 bonus points used to apply for study abroad. It takes 25 hours of involvement over 4 months to earn the bonus points, and the Head of the Committee (International Student Coordinator) is responsible for counting the hours and recording them with THS.

The committee recruits at the beginning of each semester, when a number of organizers who are tagged to participate in the organization of events are recruited. However, the committee is open to new organisers all year round. If you are interested in joining the committee, please apply for membership (write to [isc@datasektionen.se](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se)).

## Reducing Barriers for International Students

The International Committee has a project called "Translating Governance Documents". The project aims to translate [important documents](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/) into English, so that international students can have a better understanding of what is happening in the Computer Science Chapter. This is a project that is open to all students in the Computer Science Chapter. If you are interested in helping with this, please contact [isc@datasektionen.se](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se).

## Events

The International Committee organises at least two events per semester for international students belonging to the Computer Science Chapter or the Media Technology Chapter.
Examples of events include international gasques, movie nights, board game nights, karaoke nights, networking events (to introduce the Chapter's committees/clubs) or even outdoor activities such as ice skating or hiking. At the beginning of each semester, the committee also collaborates with the Computer Science reception (only autumn semester) and the international reception organised by THS (every semester). 

## International Reception

The International Committee is not responsible for the international reception. THS organises a reception for international students at the beginning of each semester. The reception is a great opportunity to meet international students and participate in fun activities.
