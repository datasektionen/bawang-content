# The Sports Committee

The Sports Committees activities depends entirely on what it’s members want to do. We focus on participating in all events of the THS Championships and to keep continuous activities alongside our studies. Currently we have about 180 members in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/datafotboll/) which is where most discussion takes place and basically all the information is made available.

Turn to the Sports Committee when you want to:

* Engage in any sport or outdoor activity
* Get to know other computer scientists in different grade levels
* Keep yourself healthy
* Meet students from other chapters and compete against them in the THS Championships, friendlies and other random
* Get information and offers on sport events within the chapter and at KTH

The activities we will mainly exercise are the ones included in the THS Championships:

* Basketball
* Floorball
* Volleyball
* Football

If you are eager to get involved with some other sport, please let me know, most things can be arranged!

Are you interested in participating in any of these activities, join the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/datakthsport) or take direct contact to the Chapter Sports Leader via [idrott@datasektionen.se](mailto:idrott@datasektionen.se).
