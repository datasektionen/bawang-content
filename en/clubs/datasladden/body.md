# Datasladden
Datasladden is the club which ensures that the chapter car Cerise stays on the road. The club is lead by Mulle/Mullerina Schmeck who is responsible for both the club and the car.

## The chapter car
The chapter car, or Cerise as it is known, is a Nissan NV300 which has been wrapped in the chapter's colours. It was bought in the spring of 2022 in VÃ¤rmland and has served the chapter well since then. The previous Cerise broke down during the autumn of 2021 and was sold to a new owner.

## What we do
Datasladden keeps track of the car and the log book. The main duty is to keep the car clean and in a good working order. If something were to happen, Datasladden will get it repaired and solved. There are a lot of other functionaries and clubs that use the car so it is important for the car to be serviceable.

## Using the car
To use the car you have to both contact Mulle/Mullerina Schmeck to receive instructions and book the car in the booking system at [bokning.datasektionen.se](https://bokning.datasektionen.se). Important information about the car and how it is used is in the Swedish [car guide](https://dsekt.se/bilguide). After each journey you have to fill in the [log book](https://dsekt.se/korjournal). Drive safe!
