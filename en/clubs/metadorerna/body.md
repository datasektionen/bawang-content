# METAdorerna

"The task of METAdorerna is to be responsible for the operation of the META chapter hall, Osquars backe 21"

We in METAdorerna work to ensure that chapter members have a pleasant place to go to for study and fellowship. We coordinate cleaning, new construction and maintenance.

META is also a party venue, so in cooperation with our barteams we make sure the beer coolers and the bass amp are working. It is also possible for chapter committees to book META for parties/activities.

## Error reporting and improvement proposals
