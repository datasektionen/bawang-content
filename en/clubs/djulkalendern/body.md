# dJulkalendern

A challenge is released every weekday in December before christmas eve at 12:15 CET.

The challenges are cryptic puzzles, hacking and other computer science related things and your task
is to solve as many of them, and as fast, as possible! The calendar has an intriguing story that
unfolds as you solve each window.

The competition is held on our website [https://djulkalendern.se](https://djulkalendern.se).

There is also a [discord server](https://dsekt.se/djul) that you can join to get updates before and
during the calendar.
