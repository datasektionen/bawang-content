# Equality Committee

The club that does everything to make students feel safe and welcome at the CS chapter!

If you discover something that you think is wrong, offensive or discriminates against any person or group, you should talk to us. It can be anything from a teacher saying inappropriate things in a lecture to a student being mean to another.

The easiest way to get in touch is contacting the committee by emailing [the head of the Equality Board](mailto:jno@datasektionen.se) or filling out [this form](jml.datasektionen.se).

If you want to work on equality issues yourself, you are welcome to come to our meetings and to join our [discussion forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/jmldiskussion/) We always post on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jamlikhetsnamnden/) when we have meetings.

You can also email the head of the committee if you want to join.

No question is too small! Contact us! <3
