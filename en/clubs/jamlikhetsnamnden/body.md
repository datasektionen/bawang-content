# The Equality Committee

The committee that does everything to ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome at the CS Chapter!

If you discover something that you think is wrong, offensive or discriminates against any person or group, you should talk to the Head of the Equality Committee (JNO). It can be anything from a lecturer saying inappropriate things, to a student being mean to someone in the Chapter. You can contact JNO by email or through the [JML form](https://jml.datasektionen.se/). You can always remain anonymous and JNO has a **duty of confidentiality**.

If you want to work with equality issues yourself, you are welcome to come to our meetings and join the committee! You can contact the committee by joining the committee's **[discord server](https://discord.gg/UjpGaB6Ckh)**. Information about meetings and events is posted there.

No question is too small! Contact us!
