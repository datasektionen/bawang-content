# The Study Board

## In Short

Never hesitate in contacting the Study Board if you have an opinion or question!
You are always welcome to participate in our meetings (take a look at [news](/en/news) for dates).

The Study Board supplies the students' opinions to teachers or individuals of concern at CSC in order to improve the CS education. If you have any thoughts regarding your education you can contact us via mail or come to our meetings. We are also responsible for answering your questions about the education, or redirecting you to someone who knows more.
 
*We are here for you* - Reach out to us or join us at our next meeting.

## About the Board

Like every Chapter at KTH, the CS-Chapter has a Study Board which works with monitoring the education at CSC. The main purpose of the Board is to assess and improve education quality as well as studying environment in both the short and long term.
For you, this means that we will give your feedback to teachers and other officials at CSC. You can reach us either via mail or by coming to our meetings. All meetings are announced at the [news page](/en/news).

We also answer your questions regarding your studies at kth or redirect you to a more knowledgeable party.

### Year representatives & Master representatives
The Year and Master representatives are students who represent their year in relation to both students and teachers. Functionally, they are a voice for students in situations where the students don't want to or cannot communicate with the teacers. Should you have opinions about the courses, teachers or related subjects, your Year representative has got you covered.

### Student Safety Representative 
The Student Safety Representative (SSO) works for a better studying environment at KTH, both the physical as well as the psychosocial environment. Don't hesitate to contact your SSO!

### Study Board President
The Study Board President (SNO) leads the Board work and the education monitorin in general. The SNO is a representative elect, and is thus bound by the chapter regulations to

* work to represent all students

* work with outreach, informing students why the board exists and how you can influence the school through us 
* be responsible for gathering and documenting information regarding the work of the Board som it can be reviewed and reused by the chapter at a later point
 
The SNO is interested in the students' opinions both regarding the education and the Board itself, to be able to complete the work mentioned in the relgement. Maybe you could help us work with the right education-related problems.

### Programme responsible student
The Programme responsible student (PAS) works together with SNO to improve education quality. The PAS is mainly responsible for contact with teachers and other personel at the CSC-school, and generally works with the long-term work within the Study Board.
