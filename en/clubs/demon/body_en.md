# DEMON

Data Et Medias OrquesterNämnd (CS and Media's orchestra club). Lead by ÄrkeDEMON (Arch-DEMON). This is the club for everyone in the CS chapter or Me chapter who are interested in music in any way.

## Stuff

The chapter owns a few MIDI-synths, a digital drum set, an acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, and a digital piano. Everything is free to borrow, so don't hesitate to try new stuff! Send an e-mail to [arkedemon@datasektionen.se](mailto:arkedemon@datasektionen.se) if you want to borrow something.

## Rehearsal space

We don't have a permanent rehearsal space, but we tend to jam every now and then in a space by Hötorget. It's very sporadic, as often as the ÄrkeDEMON (or anybody else for that matter) feels like organising it.

## More info

Keep an eye on this website for news about when we jam or do other fun stuff. We also have a Slack. Ask the ÄrkeDEMON or somebody else who you think might be in it if you want to get an invite.
