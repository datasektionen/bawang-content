# The Baking committee

The baking committee is the chapters sweetest group, consisting of the very best pastry makers at KTH! We bake for each other and all the members of the chapter. Fill in the application if you feel like joining! You may also contact Baked directly via mail.

## Baking for SM

The committees primary mission is to bake for chapter meetings in order for as many people to stay active as possible. There are different themes tied to specific meetings. For instance, the goodies for Budget-SM should be decorated with gold.

## Other committees and projects

The baking committee is happy to collaborate with other parts of the chapter! If you are responsible for a meeting or an event and have some budget to spare, please contact Baked and we may bring you all sorts of delicacies.
