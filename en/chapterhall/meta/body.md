## META guidelines during the pandemic

* To reduce the spread of infection in META, the following guidelines have been developed:
* There may be a maximum of 50 people in META at one time according to KTH's regulations.
* The number of seats in META will be limited to 40.
* The table placement in META may not be changed and no more chairs may be added.
* If you are waiting to heat food, please wait in line outside META. Only 10 people can be in the room in addition to those sitting down.
* If META is booked, it is okay to refurnish, but after the event is finished, the furniture must be arranged according to the temporary table map.
* It is everyone's own responsibility to ensure that it is not crowded or more than 50 people in META.
