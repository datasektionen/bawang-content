# Konglig Datasektionen

Datasektionen, or the Computer Science Chapter is a non-profit
[student chapter](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentsektion)
under [THS](http://ths.kth.se) which exists to give all CS students at
KTH the best study time possible. We achieve this in part by monitoring
the courses in the programme, and in part by organizing activities
outside of the studies themselves. We're a bit like a watchdog, and
a bit like a fraternity (but more open). In the chapter there are
several groups doing specific stuff that interests them. Read more about the chapters clubs at [Clubs](/en/clubs).

## Discussion Forums

The chapter has a [Discord server](https://dsekt.se/discord), a chat platform where chapter members can discuss both study-related topics and extracurricular chapter-related activities. The server hosts course channels for the program's courses where students can get help. Events that fall under the activity categories below are also advertised there. All students at KTH are welcome to join the server via the following link: [dsekt.se/discord](https://dsekt.se/discord).

## International

We have an international study coordinator who knows the most about the CS chapter's international projects. More information can be found [here](/en/clubs/internationellanamnden) or by sending an[email](mailto:isc@datasektionen.se).

## Party activities

Few engineering students could go longer than a few days without partying.
To satisty this need, we have multiple clubs including D-Festeriet and DKM, or the Club Masters of Data.

[DKM](/en/clubs/dkm), is made up of a few nice people who organize totally
incredible parties. You must think they are awesome. They are.
Parties are held at META almost every wednesday.

## Keeping an eye on the studies...

The study council makes sure that all CS students get the best education
possible. We meet at least once a period and discuss how things are going
in all the different courses and programmes. If you're experiencing problems
with the faculty or a course, you should contact us!  The study council is
open for all CS students, so anyone can come to our meetings.

## Activities and entertainment

There are many ways to have fun at the CS chater. Apart from interesting
studies and epic parties, _qultural_ events are sometimes organized. This
could be film- or gaming evenings. We also collaborate with other groups to spread _qulture_ all around the campus. Looking for company? We can help! [QN](/en/clubs/qulturnamnden)

## Industry contact

The Business relations group takes care of the chapter's contact with the professional world. We organize events together with interested companies, such as the yearly, company pubs, lunch lectures, and other events. We also help companies advertize jobs and sometimes organize something special.

The chapter also hold an annual career fare, [D-Dagen](/en/industry/d-dagen), each October where you can meet over 100 companies in the union building, Nymble.

## META, our Chapter Hall

META is the hall where CS and Media students can meet, eat and party.
The address is Osquars Backe 21 and the heroes taking care of the place
are [METAdorerna](en/clubs/metadorerna).

## Student Reception

The reception is very important for welcoming new students and making sure they
feel good coming here. The schedule and other information can be found at
the [reception website](/en/clubs/mottagningen).
