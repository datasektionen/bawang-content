# Organisation

The Computer Science Chapter is a nonprofit organisation that works for its
members interest. We have by-laws and a board of directors – and a lot of documents. At first hand we follow the Swedish laws as a nonprofit organisation. We also follow to the KTH Student Union bylaws,
rules and white paper.

The Computer Science Chapter also have their own regulatory documents. To regulate our own activities we got our [by-laws](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/stadgar) and our officials [rules](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/reglemente). [Our treasurer](https://dfunkt.datasektionen.se/position/id/9) is responsible for the chapter's economic routines - you will find them in the [PM for Economy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/pm/pm_ekonomi).

The Computer Science Chapter are also proud proprietors of a permanent
license to serve alcohol and thus we follow the Swedish Alcohol Law(Alkohollag:2010:1622). To be clear to all our members about our view on alcohol in our chapter hall and our activities
[Alcohol Policy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/alkoholpolicy).

Other policies we commit to are
[Recruitment Policy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/rekryteringspolicy),
[PM for Officials](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/pm/pm_dfunk) and our
[PM for Information Distribution](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/pm/pm_informationsspridning).
You can also find them listed on the right side of this page. We also have a [Cohabitatation Agreement](https://dsekt.se/samboendeavtal) regulating how the chapter hall META is shared between The Computer Science Chapter and the Chapter for Media Technology. 

### Members

Members are everyone who pays the chapter fee. The board of directors are members,
the officials are members, and we hope that you are a member! Every
member is allowed to attend and vote at the chapter meetings(SM).

### Chapter Meeting(Sektionsmöte, SM)

Chapter meeting, or SM, is the chapter's highest decision-making body. They could be compared with the Computer Science Chapter's annual meeting, but there are multiple every year. Every member of the Computer Science Chapter has a right to speak their mind and vote at the SM. The most important decisions affecting the chapter are made during SMs. There are four
ordinary SMs in the year; Budget-SM (Budget Meeting), Glögg-SM (Christmas Meeting), Revisions-SM (Audit meeting), and
Val-SM (Election Meeting). More chapter meetings can be arranged according to demand.

### Clubs

A club is an organisational entity created for a specific purpose. One of our clubs monitors our study environment, another takes care of the chapter hall, another arranges parties and so forth. Every club has a chairman that is elected at the SM. How to become member of a club varies from club to club. Some clubs have a limit to how many members they bring in and some have
interviews. If you want to know more about a certain club, you are welcome to contact the club's chairman! You can find the chairmans contact information under the clubs tab in [clubs](/namnder?lang=en).
If you want to create your own club by sending a motion to the board of directors. At the next Chapter Meeting, all members vote on wether or not your proposal should pass. You should make a budget, a description of your activities, and possibly formulate changes in our by-laws/rules.

It's also possible to make a project in the chapter. A project is similar to a temporary club, it is created the same way, with a motion.

### Officials

Officials are also elected at a chapter meeting. Every official is responsible for one club or activity in the chapter. If you want to get engaged in a club or activity you are welcome to turn to its volunteer!

If you want to be a volunteer you have to run for election. Most of our elections are handled at the Election Chapter Meeting (mid May) and Mulled Wine Chapter Meeting (Late November/early December) and the nomination period starts rougly one month before the meetings. To nominate and handle your nominations go to our [election page](val.datasektionen.se). If you are intrested in knowing what the responsible of a position is, you can contact
the current volunteer.

### D-directorate

The D-directorate is the board of the Computer Science chapter and consists of seven members.
They are the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer, Vice Treasurer, secretary, and four more board members that are responsible
for educational issues, student welfare and equality, student activities, and communication and business relations. Together they arrange Chapter Meetings, make sure the decisions at chapter meetings are executed, coordinate different parts of the chapter, and make strategic and long term plans.

Elections for board members are made in the same way as for officials, except for Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Tresurer.

### Statutory Auditor

The Statutory Auditor is the one that performs audit through verifying the bookkeeping, quorum and activity in an organisation. The Computer Science Chapter's Auditor examines bookkeeping and meeting protocols every year to decide if the board has done their job properly.

### How are things decided?

If you want to suggest an alteration in the documents you leave a
motion to SM. To change the by-laws it is required to be passed at to seperate SMs.

### D-directorate Meeting (D-rektoratsmöten, DM)

The Board of Directors Meeting. All of the chapter members have the right to attend and speak, but only the board have the right to vote. Every volunteer gets an invitation to DM but it's only the members of the D-directorate that are expected to attend. If a voluenteer has sent a proposal to
the board that will be handled in the meeting, they are also expected to attend.
