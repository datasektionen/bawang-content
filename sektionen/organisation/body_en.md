# Organisation

The Computer Science Chapter is a nonprofit organisation that works for its members interest. The chapter's main purpose is to enhance member's studies through monitoring of the education and by creating a good sense of community. The chapter also gives it's members good contacts to future employers and a possibility of developing your competence by working on chapter projects and leadership.

As a nonprofit organisation we have a structure to work against. We have rules that we have agreed upon, we have regular formal meetings where the most important things are decided and we have officials who carry out the activities and govern the different parts of the chapter.

## Regulatory documents

Since the Computer Science Chapter is a part of the [KTH Student Union](https://thskth.se) (THS) and uses KTH's premises we aren't only restricted by our own regulatory documents, but also their rules. [Read THS' documents here](https://thskth.se/en/general/thsdocument).

The Computer Science Chapter also have their own regulatory documents. Most of them can be found on the [webpage for regulatory documents](https://styrdokument.se). To regulate our own activities we got our [by-laws](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/stadgar) and our official [rules](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/reglemente). [Our treasurer](https://dfunkt.datasektionen.se/position/id/9) is responsible for the chapter's economic routines - you will find them in the [PM for Economy](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/pm/pm_ekonomi). Aside from the regulatory documents we also have planning documents that describe how operations will shall look like the coming year. These are the [operational plan](/sektionen/dokument?lang=en#operational-plans) and the [budget](/sektionen/dokument?lang=en#chapter-budget).

The Computer Science Chapter are also proud proprietors of a permanent
license to serve alcohol and thus we follow the Swedish Alcohol Law (Alkohollag:2010:1622). To be clear to all our members about our view on alcohol in our chapter hall and our activities we have the [PM for Alcohol](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/pm/pm_alkohol).

We also have a [Cohabitatation Agreement](https://dsekt.se/samboendeavtal) regulating how the chapter hall META is shared between The Computer Science Chapter and the Chapter for Media Technology. 

## Members

Members are everyone who studies one of the programs that belong to the chapter and who pays the [THS membership fee](https://thskth.se/en/membership). The board of directors are members, the officials are members, and we hope that you are a member! Every member is allowed to attend and vote at the chapter meetings (SM), stand for election and come to our pubs.

## Our meetings

The chapter has three types of formal meetings: chapter meetings, election meetings, and board meetings. All members are able to vote and have a say in the chapter meetings and election meetings but in the board meetings all members are welcome to participate and express their opinion but only the board can vote. All meeting protocols can be found under [protocols](/sektionen/dokument?lang=en#protocols).

### Chapter Meeting (Sektionsmöte, SM)

Chapter meeting, or SM, is the chapter's highest decision-making body. They could be compared with the Computer Science Chapter's annual meeting, but there are multiple every year. Every member of the Computer Science Chapter has a right to speak their mind and vote at the SM. The most important decisions affecting the chapter are made during SMs. There are four
ordinary SMs in the year; Budget-SM (Budget Meeting), Glögg-SM (Christmas Meeting), Revisions-SM (Audit meeting), and
Val-SM (Election Meeting). More chapter meetings can be arranged according to demand. If you want to suggest an alteration in the documents you leave a motion to SM. To change the by-laws it is required to be passed at two separate SMs. If you're wondering how SMs work you can read the SM guide at [dsekt.se/smguide](https://dsekt.se/smguide) (currently only available in Swedish).

### Election Meeting (Valmöte, VM)

VM is like SM but there's only elections of chapter officials happening and no other decisions. However, it's not all positions that can be elected at VM, since some need to be elected at SM.

### D-directorate Meeting (D-rektoratsmöten, DM)

The Board of Directors Meeting. All of the chapter members have the right to attend and speak, but only the board have the right to vote. Every volunteer gets an invitation to DM but it's only the members of the D-directorate that are expected to attend. If a volunteer has sent a proposal to the board that will be handled in the meeting, they are also expected to attend.

## Activities

<img src="https://dsekt-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/organisation/verksamhetskarta.png" style="width:100%;" />

The chapter has a wide range of activities that our members can take part of. It is led by the board and carried out by our elected officials and clubs. Every official is responsible 

### D-directorate

The D-directorate is the board of the Computer Science chapter and consists of nine members.
They are the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer, Vice Treasurer, secretary, and four more board members that are responsible
for educational issues, student welfare and equality, student activities, and communication and business relations. Together they arrange Chapter Meetings, make sure the decisions at chapter meetings are executed, coordinate different parts of the chapter, and make strategic and long term plans.

Elections for board members are made in the same way as for officials, except for Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Treasurer.

### Clubs

A club is an organisational entity created for a specific purpose. One of our clubs monitors our study environment, another takes care of the chapter hall, another arranges parties and so forth. Every club has a chairman that is elected at the SM. How to become member of a club varies from club to club. Some clubs have a limit to how many members they bring in and some have
interviews. If you want to know more about a certain club, you are welcome to contact the club's chairman! You can find each club's chairman's contact information under the respective club's tab in [clubs](/namnder?lang=en).

If you want to create your own club you do this by sending a motion to the Chapter Board. At the next Chapter Meeting, all members vote on whether or not your proposal should pass. You should make a budget, a description of your activities, and possibly formulate changes in our by-laws/rules to define the club.

It's also possible to make a project in the chapter. A project is similar to a temporary club, it is created the same way, with a motion.

### Officials

Officials are also elected at a chapter meeting. Every official is responsible for one club or activity in the chapter. If you want to get engaged in a club or activity you are welcome to turn to its volunteer!

If you want to be an official you have to run for election. Most of our elections are handled at the Election Chapter Meeting (mid May) and Mulled Wine Chapter Meeting (Late November/early December) and the nomination period starts roughly one month before the meetings. To nominate and handle your nominations go to our [election page](https://val.datasektionen.se). If you are interested in knowing what the responsible of a position is, you can contact the current official.

### Statutory Auditors

The Statutory Auditor is the one that performs audit through verifying the bookkeeping, quorum and activity in an organisation. The Computer Science Chapter's Auditors examines bookkeeping and meeting protocols every year to decide if the board has done their job properly.

### Student Union Council

Union Council (KF) is the highest decision-making body of THS.

The Student Union Council shall make decisions regarding the organisation of THS and determine comprehensive guidelines and the financial framework of the activities of THS. The Student Union Council shall also monitor the activities of the Student Union Board and consider granting discharge of liability for the board. The Speaker’s Presidium shall preside over the work of the Student Union Council.

The CS Chapter, like all other chapters, has representatives in the Student Union Council. You can message them at [kf@datasektionen.se](mailto:kf@datasektionen.se)
