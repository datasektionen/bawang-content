# Emergency plan - Konglig Datasektionen

The difference between a crisis and an accident is the severity of the event. An event that we can quickly fix ourselves such as a minor injury, for example a broken plate, is an accident. An event that could severely damage our brand or our business is a crisis. Obviously, we want to prevent both types of events in our business and manage them as well as possible. However, the latter type of event is usually more difficult to handle well instinctively, which is why a crisis plan is in place to help guide the handling of such situations.

The chapter's emergency plan is available at [dsekt.se/emergency](https://dsekt.se/emergency) and physically in META.

## Medical kit, defibrillators and accident management

In META there are two medical boxes, one large and one small. The small one can be taken with you when you have events that are not in META, such as the LÃ¥dbilsquarnevalen or Osqvik. The large box should never leave META. The student safety officer (sv. Studerandeskyddsombud) is responsible for inventorying the large medical box.

There is a defibrillator in META hanging on the wall next to the emergency exit, just before entering the hall. Modern defibrillators are so easy to use that no specific training is needed.
