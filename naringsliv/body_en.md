# The Business Relations Group

Do you want to come in contact with computer science students?
The Computer Science Chapter's Business Relations Group actively works for an increased
cooperation beetween computer science students and the industry. We will help
you arrange events in order for students to come in contact with your company
and to give them a glimpse of their future working life.

We offer many ways for you to contact students: lunch lectures, advertisment,
using the Computer Science Chapter's job board, etc. We will also gladly discuss
any new ideas with you. Looking for a more traditional approach? Take a look at
our traditional events, listed below.

Please feel free to contact us within the Business Relations Group by mail
for more information.
