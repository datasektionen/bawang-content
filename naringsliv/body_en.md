The Computer Science Chapter's Business Relations Group actively works for an increased
cooperation beetween computer science students and the industry. We will help

We offer many ways for you to contact students: lunch lectures, advertisment,
using the Computer Science Chapter's job board, etc. We will also gladly discuss
any new ideas with you. Looking for a more traditional approach? Take a look at
