# Frequently asked questions

## Examination

### How long can the grading of an exam take?
Every student has the right to have their handwritten exams graded without any unmotivated delays. The result of the exam should be communicated to the students within three weeks (15 work days) after the date of the exam and at least 7 days before a potential reexam. The result should be communicated directly to individual students via [Ladok](https://www.student.ladok.se/student/app/studentwebb/).

### What should I do if the grading takes longer than expected?
If only your own results are taking longer, contact the examiner. Should this not help or the results are late for the whole course, we recommend you contact the Study Committee so that we can try and contact the examiner or the programme director if needed.

### When can I do a complementary examination?
"Complementary examination must be held within six weeks, counted in semester time, after the students have received their results from the original exam and before the next exam." This in practice means that you should get notified of complementary examination when the results are published.

### How do I sign up to my exams?
Log in to Ladok using your KTH account. Then press the Examinations section on sidebar. After that press the "Sign up" button for those exams you want to sign up to.

### Who do I contact regarding course registrations?
First and foremost the Study Counselor (<svl-data@kth.se>) or course responsible/examinator.

### Can I re-register myself to a course?

## Credit requirements

### There are two or more obligatory moments I have to attend at the same time, what do I do?
Mail you programe responsible while informing the course responsibles for both of the courses and the Study Comittee.

**What happens if I fail a course?**  
Failing a course could mean that you won't be eligible to take any course that has that course as a requirement. You can always talk to the Study Counseller and request to re-take the course.

Don't forget, you can always ask when you are uncertain! You can always conatact the Study Committee, we are always ready to help!
